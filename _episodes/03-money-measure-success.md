In this episode we reflect on our journeys in social entrepreneurship; one journey stopping early on and the other going from strength to strength. We consider the big questions that might be stopping you from taking the leap into entrepreneurship including job/financial security (or lack there of) in the early days of start-ups, but also the risk involved in stepping away from the professional corporate path.
