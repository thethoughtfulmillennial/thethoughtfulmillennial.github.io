title: "Your motivations to keep going"
description: "When I started my journey in Drupal back in 2016, I didn't know how it would become one of the main work I would be doing years later. Back then I was accepted for an internship at MD Systems GmbH in Zurich, Switzerland. While working with them I was able to learn a lot about communities and the interaction with other developers to collaborate with the same vision. It was also thanks to Drupal that I was able to attend to DrupalCon 2018 in Nashville, Tennesse and other big events where I could share with people who saw the code as a tool to create a community."
