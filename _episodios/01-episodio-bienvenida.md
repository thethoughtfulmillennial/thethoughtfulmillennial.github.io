Drupal is content management software. It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.

When I started my journey in Drupal back in 2016, I didn't know how it would become one of the main work I would be doing years later. Back then I was accepted for an internship at MD Systems GmbH in Zurich, Switzerland. While working with them I was able to learn a lot about communities and the interaction with other developers to collaborate with the same vision. It was also thanks to Drupal that I was able to attend to DrupalCon 2018 in Nashville, Tennesse and other big events where I could share with people who saw the code as a tool to create a community.

## Contribution
With Drupal, I got to contribute to:
- Paragraphs is one of the most used Drupal modules at the moment. It allows users to add a replacement for the Body field (where the user usually adds the conent of a page) with a dynamic field where the user can add different types of Paragraphs with differente fields and configuration.
Around my work with Paragraphs I was lucky to implement:
    1. The behavior plugin system [See more](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs/issues/2828506).
    2. The paragraph summary [See more](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs/issues/3012053)
    3. "Add before" button [See more](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs/issues/2946514)
- Diff displays the differences between revisions comparing the changes inline and github like. In this module, I fixed lots of bugs, changed the settings management from being field storage based to entity field based, added a new way for displaying changes named as the “Visual Inline” layout, added image display on revision comparison, added a new changes summary on the revisions listing view and make each layout a plugin so it can be extended.
- Many other modules by fixing bugs, adding new features, updating documentation and providing feedback to patches provided by other community members.

## Achievements
- In 2018, I got a DrupalCon grant to attend to the event in Nashville, Tennesse. I was one of the 11 community members that got a grant worth of 2500USD for travel expenses.
- In 2016, I gave my first international talk at Drupal Dev Days, Milan.
- In 2018, I gave a talk at Drupal Europe, Darmstadt, Germany.
- In 2019, I gave a talk at Drupal Mountain Camp, Davos, Switzerland.
