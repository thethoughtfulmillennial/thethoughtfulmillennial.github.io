In this episode we talk about how fear can be an active motivator or demotivator in personal and professional life. We think back to our earliest memory of "what we wanted to be when we grew up" and *spoiler alert* whether fear played a part in redirecting us from those early ambitions. We also discuss how changing your perspective of fear as less 'active' and more of a 'passive' emotion can be empowering and enable more healthy risk taking in life.
