In this episode, we discuss our approach to expressing gratitude for life as it is. Making time to identify the small privileges that are easy to overlook and the once-in-a-lifetime milestones which elevate us. Sometimes though there's a little voice reminding you nothing can last foreverâ€¦ but we continue our pursuit to experience gratitude for that moment.
